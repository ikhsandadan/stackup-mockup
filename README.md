# Project: StackUp Website Enhancement

[StackUp Mockup App](https://stackup-mockup.vercel.app/)
As part of the StackUp Hackathon, I've implemented key features to enhance the StackUp website's functionality and user experience:

 **1.** **Dark Theme: Improves visual comfort with switchable light/dark modes, reducing eye strain and enhancing readability.**

 **2.** **Modal Login/Signup: Streamlines user access with pop-up forms, maintaining page context and accelerating account processes.**

 **3.** **Collapsible Side Drawer: Maximizes content viewing area, particularly beneficial for smaller screens and users preferring a  cleaner interface.**

 **4.** **Informative Tooltips: Provides contextual information on key buttons, improving feature clarity and user guidance.**


 **5.** **Enhanced Profile Menu: Redesigned with an easily accessible logout button, improving account navigation.**

 **6.** **Leaderboard Feature: Inspired by Discord's battle royale concept, showcasing:**

   1. Top 3 users on the main page and Leaderboard page.
   2. Comprehensive rankings, scores, completed quests, and bounties.
  
   Scoring System:
  
   3. 1 point per minimum approved quest.
   4. 3 points per minimum approved bounty.
   And i add them all up.


 **7.** **Improved Account Page: Allows users to update profile picture, username, nationality, career level, role / expertise area, and tech stacks, enhancing profile personalization**

 **8.** **Adding a Store page for users to redeem Stackcoin.**
 
 Here, users can exchange Stackcoin they have earned (which can be obtained from Discord as quiz rewards or from quests that offer Stackcoin as prizes). The Store can contain StackUp merchandise or any items that users find   interesting.

For testing purpose you can login with user **8dfz62t4m@mozmail.com** and password **User#1234** or you can test signup with your own account (dont worry password is encrypted and stored in database).

These enhancements aim to increase user engagement, enrich learning experiences, and foster a stronger StackUp community. The balanced scoring system motivates users to improve skills through various challenges.

The implemented features reflect current trends in online educational platforms, focusing on user needs and engagement. They create a more immersive, rewarding, and user-friendly environment that aligns with StackUp's educational goals while promoting community growth and healthy competition.

For a live demonstration of these new features, please refer to the accompanying video.
